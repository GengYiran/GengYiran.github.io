The current state of this blog (with the last post 2 years ago) makes it look like I've disappeared. I've certainly become less active on blogs since I've joined Tesla, but
whenever I do get a chance to post something I have recently been defaulting
to doing it on Medium because it is much faster and easier. I still plan to come back 
here for longer posts if I get any time, but I'll default to Medium for everything short-medium in length. 

### TLDR 

**Have a look at my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@karpathy/).**
