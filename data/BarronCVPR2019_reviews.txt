R1:

My first impression is that this paper might be better reviewed in a machine
learning centered conference (i.e. ICML) instead of the computer vision ones,
as the major contribution of this paper comes from the loss function that could
be potentially applied to any learning task, not specific vision task.

Borderline Reject


R2:

Good theoretical development of unified robust loss and extensive experimental
evaluation on four vision task.

Accept
