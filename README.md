I am a three-year undergraduate student in Turing class at the School of Computer Science, Peking University and a research intern at Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), working with Prof. Hao Dong and Prof. Yaodong Yang. I also had the privilege of working closely with Prof. He Wang.
